                    <p>A haunted priest confronts an apocalypse of his sins...<br>
                      The last days of a doomed conquistador...<br>
                      An impossible realm of painted nightmares...<br>

                      These are but glimpses into the world of Beyond the Book of Eibon, a literary tribute to the mind-boggling terrors and bizarre atmospheres of the maestro of Italian horror film Lucio Fulci with a bounty of original short fiction. Taking inspiration from the horrors and atmospheres of Fulci’s works, fifteen established and up-and-coming weird fiction authors including Adam Cesare (Clown in a Cornfield), Gemma Files (Experimental Film), Christopher Slatsky (The Immeasurable Corpse of Nature), and Matt Serafini (Rites of Extinction) have put together their own spine-tingling stories taking cues from all sides of Fulci’s career, from his infamous cosmic-splatter films to his outré exercises in dark fantasy and gothic westerns. Additionally, the book will contain a forward by Kier-La Janisse, whose landmark House of Psychotic Women helped redefine the critical approach to exploitation films in the 2010s.

                  <p>Nature is a haunted house-but Art-is a house that tries to be haunted.<br>
                    - Emily Dickinson -<br><br>

                    You know the house. The one at the end of the road down the long driveway that seems to have a permanent shadow hanging over its head. One that sends shivers up the spines of people who pass as they quicken their pace and bow their head in the hopes nothing will happen to them. The one that is the gossip of the water-cooler, yet no one really knows why.<br>

                    In Death House, several talented authors take us on a journey through the houses they see in their nightmares. Ones that contain all manner of haunts, horror, death and destructions. Houses that may not simply be plucked from the imagination, but may in fact exist in reality.<br>

                    Be wary of the house whose door you step through.<br>
                    You can never be sure what is on the other side.
